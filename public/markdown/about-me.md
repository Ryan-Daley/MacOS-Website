Hello! I'm Ryan, a recent MSc Data Science graduate from the University of Essex who previously received his bachelor's degree in International Relations & Politics from the University of Portsmouth.

Coming from a humanities background I have developed a strong interest in the intersection of data analysis and real-world problems. Through my studies I have gained a foundational understanding of statistical analysis and visualization techniques and I am eager to further develop my skills in these areas.

My current research interests and goals are primarily to do with exploring more adavanced machine learning techniques, focusing particularly on natural language processing! Please feel free to reach out!
